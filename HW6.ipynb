    "OneR essentially is a majority voting. For instance, if the majority of the female passengers (gender = female) in the training set survived the tragedy, the OneR classifies all the females in the test set as survived (1). If the majority of the male passengers (gender = male) in the training set did not survive the tragedy, the OneR classifies all the males in the test set as not survived (0). Therefore, OneR for this feature could be the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "OneR(gender) = if the passenger was female, she survived.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if the majority of the first class passengers (pclass = 1) in the training set survived the tragedy, the OneR classifies all the first class passengers in the test set as survived. Next, its checks the second class passenger (pclass=2). If the majority of the second class passengers (pclass = 2) in the training set survived the tragedy, the OneR classifies all the second class passengers in the test set as survived. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, repeat this step for the third class passengers (pclass = 3). Letâ€™s assume that the majority of the third class passenger in the training set did not survived. In this case, OneR for this feature could be the following: \n",
