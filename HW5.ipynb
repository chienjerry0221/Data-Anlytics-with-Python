    "3. bmi: The body mass index (BMI), which provides a sense of how over- or under-weight a person is relative to their height. BMI is equal to weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. An ideal BMI is within the range of 18.5 to 24.9.  A person with a BMI value within the range of 25 to 29.9 is considered overweight. A person with a BMI value above 30 is considered obese. \n",
